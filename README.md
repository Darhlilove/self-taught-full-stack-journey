This is my journey to full-stack software development, after two unsuccessfully attempts in the past. This time it is going to be a self-taught path, following the guide created by Abdel Altarazi (link: https://github.com/aaltarazi98/fullstack-guide-2022).

A summary of the path is as follows:

- CSS & HTML
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- Build a project with Git, vanilla CSS, HTML, and JS
- Node.js & NPM
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Build a project with React.js in TypeScript
- Express.js
- MongoDB & PostgreSQL
- Build a full-stack project with either MERN or PERN (or BOTH)
- Bonus material, and projects with bonus material
- Build my portfolio & resume
- LC & Sending out Applications

All support and guidance are welcome.

Wish me success!
