This is my journey to full-stack software development, after two unsuccessfully attempts in the past.
This time it is going to be a self-taught path, following the guide created by Abdel Altarazi (link: https://github.com/aaltarazi98/fullstack-guide-2022).
All support and guidance are welcome.
Wish me success!
