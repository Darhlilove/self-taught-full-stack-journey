# My Full-Stack Development Journey

Welcome to my personal journey towards becoming a full-stack software developer! After two unsuccessful attempts in the past, I am embarking on a self-taught path this time. I’m following the comprehensive guide created by [Abdel Altarazi](https://github.com/aaltarazi98/fullstack-guide-2022).

## Learning Path
